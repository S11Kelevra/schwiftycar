Practice2++:
	Combination of several data sets, each consisting of 3 laps with one lap or reversing.
	Trained 10-20 epochs 10-20 steps.
	Cam1 Final: loss: 0.1099 - acc: 0.9703 - val_loss: 0.0430 - val_acc: 0.9927
	cam2 Final: Unknown
	Pretty good model, tends to favor the inside line and caut corners a bit. Good at reversing twice before attempting to turn.

P0v0:
	Three laps and one lap reverse data.
	Trained 20 epochs 20 steps.
	Cam 1 Final: loss: 0.1350 - acc: 0.9617 - val_loss: 0.0396 - val_acc: 0.9894 
	Cam 2 Final: loss: 0.2236 - acc: 0.9289 - val_loss: 0.1209 - val_acc: 0.9700
	Favors left hand turns too much.

P0v1:
	retrained P0v0 data_set with practice2++ model
	Trained 20 epochs 20 steps.
	Cam 1 Final: loss: 0.0754 - acc: 0.9828 - val_loss: 0.0161 - val_acc: 0.9944
	Cam 2 Final: loss: 0.0948 - acc: 0.9727 - val_loss: 0.0598 - val_acc: 0.9850
	Slightly better than its predecessor, still favoring the inside line but completed 2/5 laps with only
	the rear tires crossing. Fairly high accuracy (albiet slow) when exp date it set too 100ms.
	Toss up between v0 for best model so far.
P0v2:
	retrained v1 with the outer data set.
	Trained 20 epochs 20 steps.
	Cam 1 Final:
	Cam 2 Final: loss: 0.0316 - acc: 0.9914 - val_loss: 8.5767e-04 - val_acc: 1.0000 (something wrong here)
	Not so great. Definetly moving away from the inner line but it seems to be a little over sensitive.
	Perhaps placing car well over the inside line before taking another outerset would work?
	
P0v3:
	Retrained P0v1 with data set of two laps favoring the outside line and one reverse.
	10-30-2017 @ 5:30pm.
	Trained 20 epochs 20 steps.
	Cam 1 Final: loss: 0.1263 - acc: 0.9672 - val_loss: 0.0552 - val_acc: 0.9810
	Cam 2 Final: lloss: 0.1654 - acc: 0.9555 - val_loss: 0.1372 - val_acc: 0.9538
	Pretty good model. Completing most laps without crossing the lines, has trouble backing out.
	ran at 8:30 and did not do as well.

Corners:
	Small data set of the three hard turns on the track as well as some reversing data.
	No model made, used for retraining existing models.
Ouuter:
	Small data set of car physcally held and moved on the inside lane while inputing right turn.
	No model made, hopfull with help car move to the center of the lane.

Practice++corners:
	Practice2++ model retrained with corners data set.
	Trained 20 epochs with 20 steps.
	Cam 1 Final: loss: 0.1617 - acc: 0.9516 - val_loss: 0.0302 - val_acc: 0.9902
	Cam 2 Final: Unkown
	Really bad. Perhaps retraining with full laps favoring the outside line instead?
