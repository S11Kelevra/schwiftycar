Practice2++:
	Combination of several data sets, each consisting of 3 laps with one lap or reversing.
	Trained 10-20 epochs 10-20 steps.

	Pretty good model, tends to favor the inside line and caut corners a bit. Good at reversing twice before attempting to turn.

P0v0:
	Three laps and one lap reverse data.
	Trained 20 epochs 20 steps.
	Cam 1 Final: loss: 0.1350 - acc: 0.9617 - val_loss: 0.0396 - val_acc: 0.9894 
	Cam 2 Final: loss: 0.2236 - acc: 0.9289 - val_loss: 0.1209 - val_acc: 0.9700
	Favors left hand turns too much.

P0v1:
	retrained P0v0 data_set with practice2++ model
	Trained 20 epochs 20 steps.

	No model made, used for retraining existing models.

Practice++corners:
