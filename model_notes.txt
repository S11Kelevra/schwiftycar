Practice2++:
	Combination of several data sets, each consisting of 3 laps with one lap or reversing.
	Trained 10-20 epochs 10-20 steps.

	Pretty good model, tends to favor the inside line and caut corners a bit. Good at reversing twice before attempting to turn.

P0v0:
	Three laps and one lap reverse data.
	Trained 20 epochs 20 steps.
	Cam 1 Final: loss: 0.1350 - acc: 0.9617 - val_loss: 0.0396 - val_acc: 0.9894 
	Cam 2 Final: loss: 0.2236 - acc: 0.9289 - val_loss: 0.1209 - val_acc: 0.9700
	Favors left hand turns too much.

P0v1:
	retrained P0v0 data_set with practice2++ model
	Trained 20 epochs 20 steps.
	Cam 1 Final: loss: 0.0754 - acc: 0.9828 - val_loss: 0.0161 - val_acc: 0.9944
	Cam 2 Final: loss: 0.0948 - acc: 0.9727 - val_loss: 0.0598 - val_acc: 0.9850
	Slightly better than its predecessor, still favoring the inside line but completed 2/5 laps with only
	the rear tires crossing. Fairly high accuracy (albiet slow) when exp date it set too 100ms.

Corners:
	Small data set of the three hard turns on the track as well as some reversing data.
	No model made, used for retraining existing models.

Practice++corners:
	Practice2++ model retrained with corners data set.
	Trained 20 epochs with 20 steps.
	Cam 1 Final: loss: 0.1617 - acc: 0.9516 - val_loss: 0.0302 - val_acc: 0.9902
	Cam 2 Final: Unkown
	Really bad. Perhaps retraining with full laps favoring the outside line instead?
